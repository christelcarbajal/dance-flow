## General Information
- This project was a school assignment to come up with a concept/prototype for "Thunder Boom Records".
- Thunderboom Records specialises in responsible AI-powered music tools and virtual artists.
- For this project, our team has developed a solution that will allow a digital artist, give a physical live show for an audience. This is possible by using various technologies that we applied in this project. We can focus on the target group by making the performance of digital artists more interesting or more interactive.


## Project Status
Project is: _completed_


## Room for improvement:
Possible future improvements are the optimalization and styling of the website.
